# phaser-pong

Pong game built with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and TypeScript. This is my first venture into game building with JS. Currently this is only really optimised for desktop playing due to needing arrow keys to move.

## Running the game

This is also the first time I've ever used Vite but the simple reason this was used for this project is that it's quick and easy:

```
yarn dev
```
